# Primer

## Distribution and app telemetry

We operate a rapid devOps cycle: we build the app, distribute it, get feedback about how it performs and what users do with it, and then use that knowledge to feed in to further development cycles. To monitor usage and performance, we get telemetry from the client and server components of the application, as well as feedback from the users themselves. 

Some releases have restricted distribution to designated testers. We also organise 'flighting' (tests of new features with restricted audiences), and A|B testing (parallel tests of alternative UX).

Managing distributions and integrating monitoring over multiple client and server components isn't a trivial task. This process is an essential part of the architecture of the application: we couldn't create a good app of this kind without an iterative development cycle and good monitoring tools. 

So in this section, we'd like to share with you how we manage our devOps cycle.

## Developer Analytics toolkit

This is the set of tools we use. They work well as an integrated kit, but they can also be used separately, or replaced by your favorite alternatives.

* GitHub - code repository
 * An alternative would be VS Team Services source control. It's a more centralized solution that can run either in the cloud or on-premises.
* Visual Studio with Xamarin - IDE
 * Alternative IDEs would be Xamarin Studio, Android Studio, XCode, Eclipse. All of these work well with GitHub and VS Team Services.
 * Visual Studio can run as a front end to GitHub, VS Team Services task management, build and test services.
* VS Team Services - cloud-based build, test and deploy service
* HockeyApp - test management, crash reporting and usage analytics
*  Application Insights - detailed analytics

Here we'll focus on the build, distribution and feedback/analytics side of the cycle.

Every code commit can trigger a build, and deploy the app to test users. Crash data and user feedback with screenshots are directly collected when running the app, and fed back into work items for the next cycle. Usage telemetry is also collected.

BTW, these tools are all free (for smaller volumes of analytics).


## Build, distribution and feedback - client apps

* **Code:** We develop with Visual Studio, and use GitHub for version control. You can use Visual Studio as a front end to manage builds and version control.
* **Build:** A code change in the GitHub repo triggers a compile and **test**, which runs in the cloud (or can run on-premises). The [continuous integration in VS Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/features/continuous-integration-vs) can handle code for all the major device platforms, languages, and unit test frameworks.
* **Distribution:** Build output for client devices is pushed to a HockeyApp private app gallery, from where testers can get and update the mobile app. Update notifications are handled automatically.
* **Feedback:** Once the client app is installed on a test userâ€™s device, [HockeySDK](http://hockeyapp.net/blog/2015/11/18/introducing-mobile-devops.html) collects usage data, **crash reports**, and user feedback with screenshots. Usage data includes counts of daily and monthly active users, new users, sessions, and crash impacted users.
* It creates work items/issues for each new crash group.

## Build, deployment and monitoring - server app

The web backend for the mobile app is an ASP.NET 4.5.1 application in C#.

* **Code:** Developed with Visual Studio 2013, with code stored on GitHub. Visual Studio is used to control commit, build and publish, with local and remote debugging.
* **Build and deploy:** [Continuous delivery in VS Team Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso/) triggers republication on a successful build and test.
* **Analytics:** [Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-overview/) monitors the performance and usage of the live application, and provides powerful diagnostic facilities for any issues that arise.

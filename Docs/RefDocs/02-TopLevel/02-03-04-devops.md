# Primer

## Build, measure, learn

We operate a rapid [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) cycle: we build and distribute the app; get feedback about how it performs and what users do with it; and then use that knowledge to feed in to further development cycles. To monitor usage and performance, we get telemetry from the client and server components of the application, as well as feedback from the users themselves. 

Some releases have restricted distribution to designated testers. We also organise 'flighting' (tests of new features with restricted audiences), and A|B testing (parallel tests of alternative UX).

Managing distributions and integrating monitoring over multiple client and server components isn't a trivial task. This process is an essential part of the architecture of the application: we couldn't create a good app of this kind without an iterative development cycle and good monitoring tools. 

So in this section, we'd like to share with you how we manage our devOps cycle.

## Developer Analytics toolkit

This is the set of tools we use. They work well as an integrated kit, but they can also be used separately, or replaced by your favorite alternatives.

* GitHub - code repository
 * An alternative would be VS Team Services source control. It's a more centralized solution that can run either in the cloud or on-premises.
* Visual Studio with Xamarin - IDE
 * Alternative IDEs would be Xamarin Studio, Android Studio, XCode, Eclipse. All of these work well with GitHub and VS Team Services.
 * Visual Studio can run as a front end to GitHub, VS Team Services task management, build and test services.
* VS Team Services - cloud-based build, test and deploy service
* HockeyApp - test management, crash reporting and usage analytics
*  Application Insights - detailed analytics

Here we'll focus on the build, distribution and feedback/analytics side of the cycle.

BTW, these tools are all free for the basic versions.


### Build, distribution and feedback - device software

The mobile app can run on several devices. 

Every code commit can trigger a build, and deploy the app to test users. Crash data and user feedback with screenshots are directly collected when running the app, and fed back into work items for the next cycle. Usage telemetry is also collected.

* **Code:** We develop with Visual Studio, and use GitHub for version control. You can use Visual Studio as a front end to manage builds and version control.
* **Build:** A code change in the GitHub repo triggers a compile and **test**, which runs in the cloud (or can run on-premises). The [continuous integration in VS Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/features/continuous-integration-vs) can handle code for all the major device platforms, languages, and unit test frameworks.
* **Distribution:** Build output for client devices is pushed to a HockeyApp private app gallery, from where testers can get and update the mobile app. Update notifications are handled automatically.
* **Feedback:** Once the client app is installed on a test user’s device, [HockeySDK](http://hockeyapp.net/blog/2015/11/18/introducing-mobile-devops.html) collects usage data, **crash reports**, and user feedback with screenshots. Usage data includes counts of daily and monthly active users, new users, sessions, and crash impacted users.
* It creates work items/issues for each new crash group.



### Build, deployment and monitoring - server app

The web backend for the mobile app is an ASP.NET 4.5.1 application in C#.


![](./media/devops-010.png)


* **Code:** Developed with Visual Studio 2013, with code stored on GitHub. Visual Studio is used to control commit, build and publish, with local and remote debugging.
* **Build, test and publish:** [Continuous delivery in VS Team Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso/) triggers republication on a successful build and test.
* **Backend host:** [Azure Mobile App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-value-prop/) provides the infrastructure for web hosting, push notifications, and authentication.
* **Analytics:** [Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-overview/) monitors the performance and usage of the live application, and provides powerful diagnostic facilities for any issues that arise.


## Device app distribution and feedback

Our most effective testing is done in the field. The first test of a new feature is on our development devices; but the real hammering comes from putting the feature to real use. Therefore we release any new feature to a small number of friendly testers first; and then a larger group; and then release to the world. At each stage, we take feedback and update our designs and priorities accordingly.

HockeyApp manages these parts of the cycle: managing testing on growing sets of test devices, and feedback. Feedback comes in two kinds: words from the users themselves, augmented with screenshots; and automated reports of crashes and usage counts.

To use HockeyApp, you install its SDK in your code, and connect VS Team Service to your HockeyApp account.

### Distribution

Visual Studio Team Service build automatically pushes the results of release builds to HockeyApp.  

In the HockeyApp dashboard, you choose a group of testers and send invitations to them to download and test your app.

HockeyApp can be configured so that when a new release arrives, the existing users are automatically notified. They just have to accept the pop-up invitation, to get the update.

HockeyApp [manages your test teams](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/app-management-2/how-to-invite-beta-testers). People can apply to join, and you can invite people. The dashboard shows you who is testing which of your apps.


### Test coverage

HockeyApp produces charts of the usage of different features, so that you can see how much each has been tested. They're segmented by device type and OS version.

You also get charts of which testers used the app, and for how long, so that you can easily follow up with particular testers.

### User feedback


### Crash reports





## Server app build and publication

The mobile app backend component takes the form of a web service hosted on Microsoft Azure. The Azure Mobile App backend service provides a framework that takes care of things like push notifications. 

To [configure the backend service](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-how-to-use-server-sdk/#publish-server-project), we add its SDK to our app and create an instance of the backend service as an Azure resource. There's a Visual Studio extension for Azure that makes this all a matter of a few clicks. 

Optional modules for the SDK handle [authentication](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-how-to-use-server-sdk/#how-to-work-with-authentication), [database access](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-how-to-use-server-sdk/#how-to-define-a-table-controller), [push notifications](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-how-to-use-server-sdk/#how-to-add-push-notifications-to-a-server-project), and other features.

When you've developed your app to the publication stage, there's a Publish wizard that uploads the code to Azure and runs it.



## Server performance analytics

The Azure web host automatically provides us with some performance data as soon as we set up the app, such as network, disk, CPU usage. These help us decide if we need to scale up, asking Azure to assign us more resources. 

In addition, we use [Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-overview/) to monitor the performance and usage of the app. It also provides valuable diagnostic search tools if any problems turn up, and will send us alerts if there are sudden suspicious rises in exception or failed request rates. 


![](./media/devops-050.png)

To [set up Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-asp-net/), we install the SDK in the server project. It's more or less a one-click operation in Visual Studio. (Well, maybe two clicks. Easy, anyway.) The SDK's role is to count and time incoming HTTP requests, do the same with calls to external dependencies such as the database and REST calls, and report exceptions. We can also write our own telemetry to monitor anything we want, either diagnostic traces or usage statistics. 

All this telemetry is sent to the Application Insights service, which creates performance and [usage dashboards](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-portal/) and provides diagnostic tools. At the same time as installing the SDK, the configuration tool sets up an Application Insights resource in Azure. This is where we go to [look at the charts](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-metrics-explorer/) or do [diagnostic searches](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-diagnostic-search/) when the app is live.

### Performance tuning

One of the key charts in Application Insights shows response times together with request counts over the past day (or week, or hour, at your choice). As well as telling you how much use your app is getting, it shows you how your app performs under load. If there's a sudden rise in the response time as request rate goes over a particular figure, then you'll know you've hit a bottleneck somewhere. It might be as simple as not enough CPU; or it might be that one of your dependencies is letting you down.

There's a set of charts that shows the rates and respinse times for calls from your app to external dependencies such as databases or REST APIs. If the rise in your app's response time is accompanied by a rise in response times to calls to another component, then you know that your problem is with that dependency - not inside your app.

### Alerts

Application Insights automatically sends you alerts if your app is responding slowly to HTTP requests. (You can also manually set up alerts to be sent when various metrics cross a threshold.) This helps you respond quickly if there's a sudden surge in interest in your app - or if your most recent release turns out to have some issues.

You can also get alerts on rates of failed requests and on exceptions. Every busy app has a background rate of a few of these, so you won't get a mail for every individual exception (unless you really want that); but Application Insights looks at the rate of these occurrences and alerts you if the rate rises. 

### Diagnostics

When you do have a problem, the first thing you want to do is look at specific events and find out more about them.

Application Insights comes with some particularly powerful search tools that let you make SQL-like queries over the logged requests, exceptions, and other events. For example, there's a pattern-finding query that can find out if failed requests had any particular combination of properties, such as a particular client type or location.

### Usage 

We'd like to know what our users are doing with the app. 

HockeyApp gives us a lot of usage data straight from the devices. The main purpose there is to show how much each feature has been tested.

But we can also code up measurements in the server, and send them as telemetry to Application Insights. We could send an event whenever a user completes a journey, and include driving score and length of journey along with the event. We can track the numbers of users achieving different levels of competence, and have those segmented and charted on the dashboard.

### Display

Application Insights has its own good dashboard and charting features, but it can also [output to Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/documentation/powerbi-content-pack-application-insights/) or other tools. This lets us combine server analytics with HockeyApp and monitoring data from IoT ingestion.
